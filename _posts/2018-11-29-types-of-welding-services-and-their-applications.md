Welding is integral part of fabrication and as component and material to be join vary widely so the types of welding. Each process address specific requirement and have sets of pros and cons.

What follows is details of common and important welding services.

## Shielded Metal Arc Welding or stick welding
An electrode holder holds metallic electrode with coated flux otherwise known as stick. Electric arc is created in between metal and electrode using either AC or DC current. This in turn causes the electrode to slowly melt away while also melting the metals to be joined. At the same time the flux coating releases a gas vapor which, together with the slag, creates a shielded environment to protect the weld area from contamination.  This welding is usually choice of fabricators or DIY enthusiast. 

## Gas Tungsten Arc or Tungsten inert gas welding 
Its one of the difficult welding technique to learn which need two hands while welding.  One hand feeds the rod while the other holds a TIG torch, in process tungsten electrode not get consumed contrary to other processes.

## Laser beam welding 
This welding technique used to join pieces of metal using laser. The laser beam provides a concentrated heat source, allowing for narrow, deep welds and high welding rates. The process is frequently used in high volume applications using automation, such as in the automotive industry.

## Robotic Welding
Nowadays it's easy to program robot and you don’t need to be rocket scientist. If you have high production or need very high precision welding then robot welding is the way to go. It is commonly used for resistance spot welding or arc welding. In era of machine learning and AI robot welder become better and better. But it can’t replace human operator to weld complex parts soon.
