In India where temperature is high throughout the year, we need refrigeration storage and trucks to deliver fresh produce and other perishable freight. A cold chain or cool chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain, which maintain a desired low-temperature of product. Based on product it also required to maintain product specific environment which include air quality levels (carbon dioxide, oxygen, humidity and others), which makes this the most complicated cold chain to operate.

Cold chains are common in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In order to maintain quality of HVAC system, cold storage provider need to maintain quality of storage in order to deliver undamaged and unspoiled goods.
Cold chains need to be evaluated and controlled based on 

1. Washout storage space

2. Maintain Storage Temperature:
Storage temperature being off by one degree can spoil the product. So be sure to watch temperature before and after loading.  Refrigerated cargo should always be loaded on precooled trailer, as extra heat getting into the cargo can raise storage temperature. 

3. Monitor Product Temperature:
Pulp thermometers are a mandatory tool for each driver; do not just rely on temperature gauge in trailer. Use pulp thermometer to record temperature of goods. It can come as cheap as 600 rupee and more high tech models of pulp thermometers, most common being digital.

4. Fuel up the tank:
Theoretically, everyone needs to stop engine at petrol pump, one might lose power to refrigeration system, which will affect storage temperature. To avoid this full your tank before going to the shipper and have extra fuel storage just in case.

5. Check Ethylene gas:
Fruit produces ethylene gas, which can be damaging to green vegetables and flowers sensitive to it. So pay attention to what produces can and cannot be on same truck.
